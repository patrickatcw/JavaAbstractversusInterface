/*
summary of differences between abstract and interface
abstract can have member variables that are inherited
interface can have variables, but they are all public static final
that never change with a public static scope
interface can't have constructors
all methods of an interface are automatically public
methods of an abstract class can have any visibility
no code in abstract methods
